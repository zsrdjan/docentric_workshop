# Lift Off Workshop for Customers

## Personalized Workshops to Help Your Team Succeed with Docentric AX

---

## Why This Workshop?

If you're working with SSRS reports in Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, you know customizations can take days or even weeks. Docentric's Word-based designer changes that, but getting your team up to speed quickly makes all the difference.

The **Lift Off Workshop** is a hands-on program where we work together on a real report from your system. Over three weeks, your team will:

- Transform one of your actual SSRS reports using Docentric
- Learn the Word-based designer through practical work, not just theory
- Get expert guidance when questions come up
- Build confidence to handle your reporting projects independently

By the end, you'll have a working template and a team that's ready to go.

**Prerequisites:** We ask that participants complete the Docentric Learning Path before the first session. It's a free, self-paced introduction (about 4-6 hours) covering Docentric basics and the Word designer. We'll send you access when you register.

If you're new to Docentric, no problem - just start with the Learning Path and apply for the workshop when you're ready.

## Responsive Considerations

While this is a single-page PDF design, for web adaptation:

- Numbered steps might stack vertically on mobile
- Cards would become full-width
- Orange decorative elements might be simplified
- Contact options could stack or become buttons
- Maintain color scheme and contrast

# Docentric Flyer Writing Instructions for Claude

## Overview
These instructions guide the creation of Docentric Customer Workshops flyers. Two versions are needed for different audiences:
1. **Customer-facing**: For end-customers considering Docentric workshops
2. **Partner-facing**: For partners who will deliver workshops to customers

## Docentric Voice and Writing Principles

All Docentric communications must follow these three core principles:

### 1. Warm, Friendly and Helpful
- Use inclusive language ("your team", "we", "together")
- Show enthusiasm and encouragement
- Be supportive and approachable
- Examples: "Ready to lift off?", "Celebrate your achievement!", "We start by understanding your needs"

### 2. Direct, Concise and Specific
- Get to the point quickly
- Use concrete numbers and details (session counts, hours, deliverables)
- Avoid vague promises - be specific about what customers get
- Examples: "4 sessions × 3 hours", "Maximum 3 attendees per company", "€3,400"

### 3. Visually Clear
- Use headers and subheaders generously
- Break content into scannable sections
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use visual markers (✓, checkmarks, dividers like ---)
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use bold for emphasis on key points

- ✓ for checkmarks/completion
- Only use when they enhance clarity

## Content Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Use active voice: "You will gain" not "will be gained"
- Address reader directly: "your team", "you finish with"
- Be confident: "You will" not "You might"
- Show results: "A confident team, ready to use Docentric effectively"
- Be specific: "4 sessions × 3 hours" not "several sessions"

### Don't:

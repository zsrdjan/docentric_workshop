## Why Offer This Workshop?

When your customers invest in Docentric, they want to see results quickly. The Lift Off Workshop gives you a structured way to get their teams productive in three weeks instead of three months of figuring it out themselves.

The workshop helps you:

- Get customers up and running faster with hands-on guidance
- Reduce the number of "how do I..." support requests later
- Build stronger relationships by working together on real projects
- Offer something valuable that sets you apart

**What you need:** Basic Docentric knowledge through the Partner Learning Path. We'll provide the workshop framework, materials, and support to help you deliver it successfully.

## How the Workshop Works

### 1. Discovery Call (1 hour)

**Getting to know your customer's needs:**
- Learn about their team's goals and current reporting setup
- Pick one SSRS report to work with during the workshop
- Discuss any specific requirements (languages, branding, special formatting)
- Plan the workshop schedule

### 2. Online Workshop Sessions (4 sessions × 3 hours each)

**Meeting twice per week, you'll cover:**
- Docentric Designer fundamentals and Word template creation
- Setting up and configuring Docentric in Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations
- Programming patterns and how to extend Docentric functionality
- Hands-on work building their actual report together

**Team size:** Up to 3 people from your company (we find this works well for teams who'll be collaborating)

### 3. Support Between Sessions (4 hours total)

**Helping them stay on track:**
- Four 1-hour support blocks spread across the program
- Answer questions that come up between sessions
- Help them keep making progress on their own
- Troubleshoot any issues they run into

### 4. Wrap-Up Call (1 hour)

**Wrapping things up:**
- Review everything accomplished together
- Answer final questions
- Talk through next steps for their ongoing work
- Share tips for maintaining and extending templates

### 5. Certificate of Completion

**Recognition for their work:**
- Each participant gets a certificate or badge showing they've completed the program

## Real-World Example

Here's how a typical workshop might go:

**Scenario:** A manufacturing customer needs to replace their SSRS purchase order report with Docentric.

**Week-by-week:**
- **Discovery call:** You learn they need multi-language support and custom branding
- **Week 1-2:** Team learns Designer basics while you build the PO template foundation together
- **Week 3:** Add their custom requirements and D365 integration
- **Week 4:** Handle their unique business rules, final refinements

**Result:** Customer has a working PO report they can deploy, plus the knowledge to maintain and extend it themselves.

Instead of a potentially drawn-out project with lots of back-and-forth, you have a clear 3-week path to success.
